## About Me

Greetings! I'm a passionate developer dedicated to crafting elegant and efficient solutions to complex challenges. My current endeavors reflect my commitment to enhancing usability and bridging gaps in various software ecosystems. Here's a glimpse into my ongoing projects:

### Current Projects

- **A 2D game written in C# using the Unity engine:** I'm developing a 2D game with my wife using C# and the Unity engine. This project aims to showcase my creativity and programming skills while exploring the intricacies of game development. I'm excited to bring this vision to life and create an engaging gaming experience.

- **Terminal Based Kanban Board Using Linux Commands for Manipulation:** I'm developing a terminal-based Kanban board that leverages Linux commands for manipulation. This project aims to streamline task management and enhance productivity by providing a seamless interface for organizing and tracking tasks.

- **Rust and Go based data tool packs to allow for data science and analytics similar to my python libraries:** I'm working on a Go-based and a Rust-based data tool pack that enables data science and analytics professionals to leverage the Rust language. This initiative seeks to empower users with efficient and high-performance tools for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

- **Sync Application for Removable Storage:** I'm developing a synchronization application tailored for removable storage. This application ensures seamless syncing of sensitive directories, such as Git repositories, while handling line-ending conversions, local discovery, and sync change management. Additionally, I'm incorporating the option to symlink externally post-sync.

- **Dotfile Sync Application:** My work involves creating a dotfile synchronization application. This tool empowers me to apply settings to non-configurable applications on mobile devices through AHK, Tasker, and iOS actions. This will also pull configurations over SSH or SCP from devices that generally dont support symlinking into a git repo like my router and unraid server. The goal is to achieve a consistent experience across platforms.

- **DIY Pocket Laptop:** My ongoing project involves building a do-it-yourself pocket laptop. This laptop is designed for remote accessibility over Tailscale, VNC, and a built-in KVM. I'm excited to create a powerful yet compact solution for on-the-go computing.

- **Portable Rack Solution:** I'm designing a cost-effective and user-friendly portable rack that can be seamlessly integrated into off-brand Pelican cases. This endeavor combines practicality with portability for a variety of applications.

- **Pocketable Laptop Enclosure for Galaxy Z Fold 4:** As part of my pursuits, I'm working on a pocketable laptop-type enclosure tailored for the Galaxy Z Fold 4. This project aims to maximize the potential of cutting-edge hardware while ensuring a compact form factor.

### Collaboration and Engagement
